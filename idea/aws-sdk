when we do like this in the lambda
var a = require('aws-sdk');
this will point to the module that inside the node_modules, so what we are going to do make a middleware between online and ofline aws-sdk in such a way that it will always keep same syntax and have ability to gives both functionalities.

So the function can have accept any function any arguments and literaly any callbacks
then based on the usuage it will choose offline or online.

Need to do before
1. require function hijacked
2. function middleware
3. arguments middleware
